Computing Efficiency of Genetic Algorithms over A* in Pathfinding

Pathfinding algorithms are some of the most widely used algorithms in both AI and game design. The industry standard for pathfinding is the A* search algorithm. The main drawback with the A* search Algorithm is that it consumes a large amount of computing power. This is compounded by the fact that the algorithm is often executed multiple times each second to account for changes in the environment. Genetic Algorithms, such as the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, make use of computing power far more efficiently. They are able to solve complex paths in less time by utilizing generational learning. We will use the Unity engine coded in C# to demonstrate visually the algorithms in practice and to prove by use of metrics the increased efficiency of Genetic Algorithms.
